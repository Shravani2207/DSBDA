This line simply displays the df DataFrame. It's often used interactively in Jupyter Notebooks, where it shows the first few rows of the dataset.
4. Checking Data Types of Columns
df.dtypes
df.dtypes: Displays the data types of each column in the DataFrame (df). This helps in identifying whether the columns are correctly typed (e.g., numeric, categorical, etc.).
5. Getting DataFrame Index
df.index
df.index: Returns the index of the DataFrame, which indicates the row labels (default is a range of integers starting from 0).
6. Getting DataFrame Information
df.info()
df.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the column names, non-null counts, data types, and memory usage.
7. Getting Shape, Size, and Summary Statistics
df.shape
df.size
df.describe()
df.shape: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (rows, columns).
df.size: Returns the total number of elements in the DataFrame (i.e., rows * columns).
df.describe(): Provides summary statistics of the numeric columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.
8. Viewing Top and Bottom Rows
df.head()
df.tail()
df.tail(5)
df.head(): Displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
df.tail(): Displays the last 5 rows of the DataFrame.
df.tail(5): Displays the last 5 rows explicitly, though df.tail() by default also shows the last 5 rows.
9. Checking for Missing Values
df.notnull()
df.isnull()
df.notnull(): Returns a DataFrame of the same shape as df, with True for non-null values and False for null values.
df.isnull(): Returns a DataFrame of the same shape as df, with True for null values and False for non-null values.
10. Inspecting Column Names
df.columns
df.columns.values
df.columns: Displays the column names in the DataFrame.
df.columns.values: Returns the column names as a numpy array.
11. Indexing and Slicing Data
df.iloc[5]
df.iloc[:,:]
df.iloc[:,3]
df.iloc[:8,:2]
df.iloc[1,1]
df.iloc[3:5,0:2]
df.iloc[5]
df.iloc[5]: Returns the entire 6th row (index starts from 0)
df.iloc[:,:]: Returns all rows and all columns (the entire DataFrame).
df.iloc[:,3]: Returns all rows from the 4th column (index 3).
df.iloc[:8,:2]: Returns rows from 0 to 7 (the first 8 rows) and columns from 0 to 1 (the first two columns).
df.iloc[1,1]:the value in the second row and second column.
df.iloc[3:5,0:2]: Returns rows from 3 to 4 and columns from 0 to 1 (subset of rows and columns).
12. Print Column Names as a List
print(df.columns.tolist())
df.columns.tolist(): Converts the column names to a list and prints it. This is useful to see all column names in a simple list format.
13. Accessing Specific Columns
df['Sepal Length']
df['Sepal Width']
df['Petal Length']
df['Petal Width']
df['Species']
Each of these lines accesses a specific column of the DataFrame. These columns are likely numerical or categorical columns, which will be used later for processing or analysis.
14. Min-Max Normalization
from sklearn import preprocessing
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
x = df.iloc[:,:4]
x_scaled = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x)
df_normalized = pd.DataFrame(x_scaled)
from sklearn import preprocessing
This imports the preprocessing module from the scikit-learn library, which contains functions for scaling, encoding, normalizing, etc.
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
This creates a MinMaxScaler object.
•	It does not change any data yet — just initializes the scaler.
•	You can now use this object to fit and transform your data.
x = df.iloc[:,:4]: Selects the first 4 columns (likely features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, etc.).
x_scaled = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x)
•	x is your original dataset (typically a NumPy array or a DataFrame).
•	fit_transform() is a two-in-one function that:
1.	fit(x) – Learns the min and max values from each feature/column in x.
2.	transform(x) – Applies the min-max scaling formula:
x_scaled is the normalized array where all values are now scaled between 0 and 1.
df_normalized = pd.DataFrame(x_scaled): Converts the scaled data back into a pandas DataFrame df_normalized.
15. Label Encoding for Categorical Data
label_encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
df['Species'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Species'])
print(df['Species'].unique())
label_encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder(): Creates a label encoder object to convert categorical labels into numeric values.
df['Species'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Species'])
•	fit_transform() does two things:
1.	fit(): Finds all unique classes in the column (e.g., 'setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica')
2.	transform(): Maps each class to a unique integer:
	'setosa' → 0
	'versicolor' → 1
	'virginica' → 2
•	Replaces the original string values in the 'Species' column with their corresponding numeric labels.
________________________________________
 print(df['Species'].unique())
Displays the unique encoded labels in the updated 'Species' column.
16. Data Type Conversion
df['Sepal Length'] = df['Sepal Length'].astype(float)
df['Species'] = df['Species'].astype('category')
print(df.dtypes)
df['Sepal Length'] = df['Sepal Length'].astype(float): Converts the Sepal Length column to float type (though it’s likely already float64).
df['Species'] = df['Species'].astype('category'): Converts the Species column to category type, which is memory-efficient for categorical data.
print(df.dtypes): Prints the data types of all columns in the DataFrame after conversion, confirming the types.

Missing values are null or NaN entries in the dataset. We can handle them by:
Deletion:
Remove rows (dropna()) or columns with too many missing values.
  Imputation:
Fill missing values using mean, median, or mode with fillna().
  Advanced Methods:
Use models like KNN imputation, regression, or iterative imputation for more accurate filling.

Feature selection
________________________________________
1. Explain DataFrame with Suitable Example
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure in Pandas. It is similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet.
Example:
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Raj', 'Anita', 'John'],
    'Age': [21, 22, 23],
    'Marks': [85, 90, 88]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
Output:
   Name  Age  Marks
0   Raj   21     85
1 Anita   22     90
2  John   23     88
________________________________________
2. What is the Limitation of the Label Encoding Method?
Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category in a column.
Limitation:
It creates an ordinal relationship between categories where none exists.
For example:
red = 0, green = 1, blue = 2
A machine learning model might think green > red, which is not true.
 Use One-Hot Encoding if categories are nominal (no order).
________________________________________
3. What is the Need for Data Normalization?
Normalization scales all feature values to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
 Purpose:
To treat all features equally
It makes training faster and more accurate.
To speed up convergence of ML algorithms
To improve accuracy by avoiding dominance of large-scale features
 Example:
Features like "age" (0–100) and "salary" (10,000–1,00,000) have different scales, which may bias the model if not normalized.
________________________________________
4. What are the Different Techniques for Handling Missing Data?
Here are common techniques:
 1. Remove missing values
df.dropna()
Removes rows/columns with NaNs.
 2. Imputation with mean/median/mode
df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)
Fills missing values with statistical estimates.
 3. Forward/Backward Fill
df.fillna(method='ffill')  # Forward fill
df.fillna(method='bfill')  # Backward fill
 4. Using ML models for imputation
Advanced method using KNN, regression, etc., to predict missing values.
