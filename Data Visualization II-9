Import Libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
 Imports the necessary libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (reading data, handling data structures).
numpy: For numerical computing (supporting large data structures like arrays).
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations (static plots).
seaborn: For statistical data visualization, built on top of Matplotlib.
________________________________________
Load Dataset:
dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/train.csv')
 Reads the dataset from a CSV file (train.csv) into a pandas DataFrame (dataset). This dataset could be related to the Titanic, where passengers' information like age, sex, survival status, etc., are stored.
________________________________________
Display First 5 Rows of Dataset:
dataset.head()
 Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset, allowing you to quickly view the data structure and understand what columns are present.
________________________________________
Create Box Plot (Sex vs Age):
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset)
 Creates a box plot to visualize the distribution of Age for each Sex (male and female). The box plot shows the following:
Quartiles: The distribution is divided into four parts, showing the middle 50% of the data.
Median: The middle value of the Age distribution for each gender (represented by a line in the middle of the box).
Whiskers: The lines extending from the box showing the range of data, excluding outliers.
Outliers: Data points that fall outside the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted as individual dots.
________________________________________
Description of Box Plot:
The box plot is used to display the distribution of categorical data (e.g., Sex) in terms of quartiles.
Explanation of the box plot:
First quartile (Q1): The 25th percentile (25% of the data points are below this value).
Second quartile (Q2): The 50th percentile (or median).
Third quartile (Q3): The 75th percentile (75% of the data points are below this value).
Whiskers: The range from the first quartile to the third quartile (excluding outliers).
Outliers: Values outside of this range, represented by individual dots.
________________________________________
Box Plot with Hue (Sex, Age, and Survival):
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset, hue="Survived")
 Creates a box plot for Sex vs Age, but this time, it uses the hue="Survived" parameter. This adds another layer to the visualization by differentiating between passengers who survived and those who didn't.
This helps to analyze how the age distribution varies between male and female passengers based on their survival status.
You can observe that younger male passengers had higher survival rates, and for females, the survival age range is different for those who survived versus those who did not.
________________________________________
Box Plot (Survived vs Fare):
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare', data=dataset)
 Creates a box plot to show the distribution of the Fare column for passengers who survived (Survived = 1) vs those who did not survive (Survived = 0). This helps visualize whether there is any significant difference in the fare price between survivors and non-survivors.
________________________________________
Box Plot (Sex vs Age) (Repeated):
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset)
Creates a box plot again for Sex vs Age, similar to the earlier box plot. This will help further visualize the distribution of ages among male and female passengers.
________________________________________
Box Plot (Survived vs Fare) (Repeated):
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare', data=dataset)
Creates a box plot again for Survived vs Fare. This is the same as in step 6 and helps further visualize the distribution of fares for survivors and non-survivors.
________________________________________
Explanation of Box Plot (General Description):
# Boxplot summarizes data using the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
# The "hue" parameter allows us to add another categorical variable for deeper insights into distributions.
 Explanation of Box Plot Components:
Five-number summary: Box plots are based on the five-number summary, which includes:
Minimum: The smallest data point excluding outliers.
First quartile (Q1): The median of the lower half of the dataset.
Median (Q2): The middle value.
Third quartile (Q3): The median of the upper half of the dataset.
Maximum: The largest data point excluding outliers.
Outliers: Points that are far from the quartiles and fall outside of the whiskers.
________________________________________
Additional Note on Box Plot Interpretation:
Box plots are useful in identifying:
Central tendency (the median line in the box).
Spread (interquartile range between the first and third quartile).
Outliers (dots outside the whiskers).
________________________________________
Summary of Visualizations:
Box Plot: Visualizes the distribution of numerical data based on quartiles.
Hue Parameter: Adds an additional layer of information (e.g., survival status) to understand how the distribution changes across categories.
Repeated Plots: Repetition of the same plots is common for deeper insights or comparisons in different contexts.
These plots and visualizations are valuable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of your dataset before proceeding with more advanced analysis.


Q1. What is the aim of this assignment?
A:
To plot a box plot showing the distribution of age with respect to each gender (sex) and survival status (survived) using the Titanic dataset.
________________________________________
Q2. What is a box plot?
A:
A box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of a dataset based on five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It also shows outliers.
________________________________________
Q3. What is the difference between a histogram and a box plot?
A:
Histogram	Box Plot
Shows frequency distribution	Shows statistical summary (median, quartiles, outliers)
Good for visualizing shape	Good for comparing groups
Doesn't directly show outliers	Clearly shows outliers
Q4. What dataset is used and how is it loaded?
A:
The Titanic dataset is used. It can be loaded using:
dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/train.csv')
________________________________________
Q5. What libraries are used for this assignment?
A:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
________________________________________
Q6. What is the purpose of %matplotlib inline?
A:
It ensures that plots are displayed directly below the code cell in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
________________________________________
Q7. What is the column ‘survived’ in Titanic dataset?
A:
It is a binary column indicating survival status:
0 = did not survive
1 = survived
________________________________________
Q8. How do you create the box plot for this assignment using Seaborn?
A:
sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='age', hue='survived', data=dataset)
________________________________________
Q9. What does the hue='survived' parameter do in the box plot?
A:
It adds an extra category (survival status) to split the box plots, making it easy to compare survivors and non-survivors by gender.
________________________________________
Q10. What can you observe from the box plot?
A:
Females had higher survival rates compared to males.
Median age of survivors is lower than that of non-survivors.
Outliers show some very young and very old passengers.
________________________________________
Q11. Why is a box plot used here instead of a histogram?
A:
Because we want to compare the distribution of ages between different categories (sex + survival), and a box plot clearly shows medians and outliers for each group.
Q12. What insights can be drawn from this box plot?
A:
Most females survived, regardless of age.
Most males did not survive, though some younger males survived.
There are outliers in both categories—very young children or older adults.
________________________________________
Q13. What if there are missing values in the age column?
A:
Box plots automatically skip null values, but it’s good practice to check and handle them using:
dataset['age'].isnull().sum()
________________________________________
Q14. How can you fill missing values in the ‘age’ column?
A:
By using methods like:
dataset['age'].fillna(dataset['age'].median(), inplace=True)
________________________________________
Q15. What does each part of a box plot represent?
A:
Center line → Median
Box edges → Q1 (25%) and Q3 (75%)
Whiskers → Data range excluding outliers
Dots outside whiskers → Outliers
________________________________________
Q16. What is the advantage of using Seaborn over Matplotlib in this case?
A:
Seaborn has a built-in boxplot() function that allows easy grouping with hue, aesthetic styling, and integration with Pandas datasets.
________________________________________
Q17. What type of plot would you use if you wanted to visualize survival based on fare and class instead?
A:
A violin plot or a swarm plot would be suitable to see how fare and class affect survival.

Q18. What is the conclusion of this assignment?
A:
Using a box plot, we observed the age distribution of passengers by gender and survival status. It helps identify age-related survival patterns and shows that females had better survival rates.
Q1. What is a box plot?
A:
A box plot is a statistical graph that shows the distribution of a dataset using five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It also helps identify outliers.
________________________________________
Q2. What does the sns.boxplot() function do in Seaborn?
A:
It creates a box plot for a categorical column (x-axis) against a numerical column (y-axis), allowing us to visualize the distribution, spread, and outliers of data.
________________________________________
Q3. What do the dots in a box plot represent?
A:
The dots are outliers, which are data points that fall outside the range defined by 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR).
________________________________________
Q4. What libraries are used here for data visualization?
A:
matplotlib.pyplot for basic plotting
seaborn for advanced, styled statistical plots
________________________________________
Q5. What dataset is used and how is it loaded?

📊 BOX PLOT QUESTIONS (AGE, SEX, SURVIVED)
________________________________________
Q6. What does the following line do?
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset)
A:
It creates a box plot showing the distribution of passenger ages for each gender.
________________________________________
Q7. What happens when we add the hue='Survived' parameter?
A:
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset, hue="Survived")
This splits the box plots by survival status (0 = not survived, 1 = survived), allowing comparison of age distributions by gender and survival.
________________________________________
Q8. What insight can we draw from this plot?
A:
Younger males had better survival chances.
Most female survivors were younger, and non-survivors had a wider age range.
The plot helps visually confirm that females had a higher survival rate overall.
Q9. What is IQR and how is it used in box plots?
A:
IQR (Interquartile Range) is calculated as Q3 - Q1, and it represents the middle 50% of data. Box plots use it to define the range of the data and detect outliers.
________________________________________
Q10. What is the 5-number summary in a box plot?
A:
Minimum (excluding outliers)
Q1 – 25th percentile
Median – 50th percentile
Q3 – 75th percentile
Maximum (excluding outliers)
________________________________________
Q11. What does this box plot indicate about the female passengers' ages?
A:
25% are aged roughly below 22–23 (Q1)
50% are between 23 and 37 (Q2 and Q3)
Outliers appear above 65
________________________________________
Q12. What is the difference between sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age') and sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare')?
A:
First shows age distribution by gender
Second shows fare distribution by survival status
________________________________________
Q13. What is the purpose of plotting sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare', data=dataset)?
A:
To compare fare paid by passengers who survived versus those who did not. It helps us see if paying higher fare increased survival chances (usually yes, due to class).
________________________________________
Q14. What are outliers in the context of Titanic’s fare or age columns?
A:
Fare: Very expensive tickets like those over $500
Age: Passengers aged very high (like over 80) or very young (under 1 year)

________________________________________
Q15. What is the difference between Matplotlib and Seaborn?
A:
Matplotlib	Seaborn
Low-level plotting library	High-level statistical plotting library
Needs more code for styling	Easier to use with better styling
Great for basic plots	Great for grouped and statistical plots like box, violin, etc.
________________________________________
Q16. What dataset does load_dataset("tips") load?
A:
It loads a sample dataset called "tips" from Seaborn, which contains data about tips received by restaurant staff.
________________________________________
Q17. Why do we repeat the line sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=dataset) multiple times?
A:
It's likely done for demonstration purposes or to test styling and visualization consistency.
________________________________________
Q18. How can we make the box plots visually better?
